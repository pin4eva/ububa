Upgrade this project to the latest Next.js version by completing the following tasks:

1. Remove all deprecated methods and features as outlined in the official [Next.js Upgrade Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading).
2. Eliminate any usage of API routes or features; refactor the codebase to use only server components as described in the [Next.js Server Components documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).
3. Update all project dependencies to their latest stable versions. Ensure compatibility with the latest Next.js release.
4. Revamp the UI design to align with current design trends, referencing popular frameworks such as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for inspiration.
5. I plan to seperate the server logic to another project, so ensure that the current project is structured to facilitate this separation in the future.
Document all changes and provide a summary of major updates in the project README.
